ARCHITECTURAL PRESERVATION LICENSE v1.0
========================================

Copyright (c) 2025 Brian Thorne

PREAMBLE
--------

This license governs the Universal Life Protocol (ULP) v1.1 implementation and
its sealed architecture. The purpose is to ensure the Five Immutable Principles
remain intact while allowing modification, distribution, and commercial use.

DEFINITIONS
-----------

"Software" refers to the ULP v1.1 implementation, including but not limited to:
  - Core utilities (bin/ directory)
  - World definition files (world/ directory)
  - Interrupt handlers (interrupts/ directory)
  - Documentation (all .md, .txt files)
  - Architecture specification (ULP-v1.1-ARCHITECTURE.txt)

"Architecture" refers to the sealed v1.1 specification with hash:
  9872936e788b17f2b2114565b2af789350ea3e155e93ee0ce5cb1f656c5a57fd

"Five Principles" refers to:
  1. Trace is Append-Only and Authoritative
  2. World Definition is Non-Executable
  3. Projections are Pure Functions
  4. Effects are Forward-Only via .interpose
  5. Information Flows Forward-Only

"Derivative Work" means any modification, extension, or translation of the
Software that retains compatibility with the Architecture.

"Breaking Change" means any modification that violates one or more of the Five
Principles.

GRANT OF RIGHTS

  - Modify the Software
  - Create Derivative Works
  - Sublicense the Software
  - Sell copies of the Software

Subject to the following conditions:

CONDITIONS
----------

1. ARCHITECTURAL PRESERVATION

   Any Derivative Work that claims compatibility with "ULP v1.1" MUST:

   a) Preserve all Five Principles without exception

   b) Maintain the authority hierarchy:
      Trace > World Definition > Projections > Effects

   c) Respect closed vocabulary sets:
      - 13 world file types (sealed)
      - 16 trace event types (sealed)
      - 13 effect symbols (sealed)
      - 16 projection classes (sealed)

   d) Reference the Architecture hash in all traces:
      9872936e788b17f2b2114565b2af789350ea3e155e93ee0ce5cb1f656c5a57fd

2. BREAKING CHANGES

   Any modification that violates the Five Principles is a Breaking Change and:

   a) MUST be released under a new major version (v2.0+, not v1.x)

   b) MUST NOT claim compatibility with "ULP v1.1"

   c) MAY use the name "ULP" but MUST clearly indicate incompatibility:
      Examples: "ULP v2.0 (incompatible with v1.1)"
                "Modified ULP (non-standard)"

   d) SHOULD document which principles were changed and why

3. ATTRIBUTION

   All copies and Derivative Works MUST include:

   a) This LICENSE file (unmodified)

   b) Copyright notice: "Copyright (c) 2025 Brian Thorne"

   c) A clear statement of any modifications made

   d) If distributed in binary form, the above notices must appear in
      documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution

4. ARCHITECTURE SPECIFICATION

   The file ULP-v1.1-ARCHITECTURE.txt is the canonical specification.

   a) This file MUST be included unmodified in all distributions claiming
      "ULP v1.1" compatibility

   b) Its SHA-256 hash MUST remain:
      9872936e788b17f2b2114565b2af789350ea3e155e93ee0ce5cb1f656c5a57fd

   c) Alternative architectures are permitted but must use different version
      numbers and filenames (e.g., "ULP-v2.0-ARCHITECTURE.txt")

5. TRACE VALIDITY

   All traces produced by the Software claiming "ULP v1.1" compatibility MUST:

   a) Include the Architecture hash in #METADATA:
      #METADATA architecture_hash 9872936e788b17f2b2114565b2af789350ea3e155e93ee0ce5cb1f656c5a57fd

   b) Follow the trace format specification exactly

   c) Be deterministically reproducible (same inputs → same trace)

   d) Support self-encoding (trace contains complete execution environment)

6. PATENT GRANT

   Each contributor grants a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free
   patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims to make, use,
   sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the
   Software, subject to these conditions.

PERMISSIONS
-----------

  ✓ Use this Software commercially
  ✓ Modify and create Derivative Works
  ✓ Distribute modified versions
  ✓ Charge for the Software or services based on it
  ✓ Create proprietary extensions (if they preserve the Five Principles)

  ✓ Sublicense under compatible terms

You MAY NOT:
  ✗ Claim "ULP v1.1 compatibility" while violating the Five Principles
  ✗ Remove or modify the Architecture hash from ULP-v1.1-ARCHITECTURE.txt
  ✗ Use version numbers v1.x for Breaking Changes
  ✗ Remove copyright notices or this LICENSE
  ✗ Use the name "ULP" to misrepresent architectural compatibility

INTERPRETATION
--------------

1. If any provision of this license is held invalid or unenforceable, the
   remaining provisions remain in effect.

2. The "Architectural Preservation" requirements apply only to works claiming
   "ULP v1.1" compatibility. Forks with Breaking Changes are permitted under
   different version numbers.

3. This license is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where the copyright
   holder resides, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

Appendix: The Five Immutable Principles
========================================

For reference, the Five Principles that must be preserved:

1. TRACE IS APPEND-ONLY AND AUTHORITATIVE
   - Trace events are immutable once written
   - The trace is ground truth, not a log
   - No retroactive modification allowed

2. WORLD DEFINITION IS NON-EXECUTABLE
   - World files contain identifier-only data
   - No control flow, no executable code
   - Validated by bin/canon.awk

3. PROJECTIONS ARE PURE FUNCTIONS
   - π(Trace) → View
   - Read-only, no side effects
   - Deterministic: same trace → same view

4. EFFECTS ARE FORWARD-ONLY VIA .interpose
   - Effects declared in .interpose file
   - EVENT → EFFECT mapping (declarative)
   - No backward causation

5. INFORMATION FLOWS FORWARD-ONLY
   - World → Trace → Projections
   - Causal ordering preserved
   - No information leakage backward

These principles define ULP v1.1 and are sealed by the Architecture hash.
