# Conversation Guide

A methodology for facilitating theological conversations using the Rumsfeld Matrix.

## Core Principles

1. **Listen more than speak** - Your role is to facilitate, not to teach
2. **Honor all perspectives** - Atheism is as valid as theism
3. **Protect the mystery** - Don't force certainty where there is doubt
4. **Document honestly** - The trace preserves the real conversation, not an edited version
5. **Create safety** - Vulnerability requires trust

## Before the Conversation

### 1. Consent & Setup (15 minutes)

**Explain the project:**
> "I'm creating a permanent record of how people understand God. This isn't about
> proving beliefs or debating theology. It's about honestly mapping what you know,
> what you don't know, and what you can't put into words. The conversation will be
> recorded and preserved as a trace - an immutable record that can't be edited later,
> only clarified."

**Obtain consent:**
- [ ] Video recording permission
- [ ] Public sharing (or audio-only, or text-only)
- [ ] Name vs. pseudonym
- [ ] Right to review before publication
- [ ] Understanding that trace can't be deleted, only annotated

**Explain the matrix:**
- Known Knowns: What you're certain of
- Known Unknowns: Questions you have
- Unknown Knowns: Intuitions you can't explain
- Unknown Unknowns: The mystery itself

**Technical setup:**
- Camera positioned to capture participant's face
- Screen/whiteboard visible showing matrix
- Good audio (lapel mic if possible)
- Test recording briefly

## During the Conversation

### Opening (5-10 minutes)

**Start gently:**
> "When you hear the word 'God', what's the first thing that comes to mind?"

Don't judge the answer. If they say "nothing" or "a myth", that's valid.

**Follow-up options:**
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "When did you first think that?"
- "Has that changed over time?"

### Known Knowns (30-60 minutes)

**Core question:**
> "What are you certain of when it comes to God?"

**Probing questions:**
- "How do you know that?"
- "Is that from scripture, experience, or something else?"
- "Have you always believed that?"
- "Could you be wrong about it?"

**Adding to matrix:**
Each statement goes in the Known Knowns quadrant. Read it back:
> "So you're saying: [statement]. Is that right? Should I place it here in Known Knowns?"

**Watch for:**
- Statements that should be Unknown Knowns ("I just know it")
- Hedging ("Well, I think maybe...") - might be Known Unknowns
- Absolute certainty - probe gently to test it

**Example flow:**
```
YOU: "What are you certain of about God?"

THEM: "God is love. That's in the Bible."

YOU: "So 'God is love' is a Known Known - you're certain of it?"

THEM: "Yes."

YOU: [Adds to matrix] "Is that certainty from scripture, or from
     experience, or both?"

THEM: "Both. I read it, and I've felt it."

YOU: "Can you tell me about a time you felt it?"

THEM: "When my grandmother died... I felt peace. Like she wasn't
     really gone."

YOU: "That peace - was that God?"

THEM: "I... I think so. But I can't prove it."

YOU: "That sounds like it might be an Unknown Known - you know
     something but can't fully articulate it. Should we put that
     in a different quadrant?"
```

### Known Unknowns (30-60 minutes)

**Core question:**
> "What questions do you have about God? What do you wish you knew?"

**Probing questions:**
- "Why does that bother you?"
- "When did that question arise?"
- "Have you looked for answers?"
- "What would it mean if you never got an answer?"

**Common Known Unknowns:**
- Why does suffering exist?
- What happens after death?
- Is there a plan for my life?
- Why doesn't God answer prayers?
- How can God be both loving and judging?
- Which religion is right?

**Watch for:**
- Questions they've given up on (might be Unknown Unknowns)
- Questions that aren't really questions (might be Known Knowns in disguise)
- Anger or pain behind the question (validate the emotion)

**Example flow:**
```
YOU: "What questions do you have about God?"

THEM: "Why did my brother have to die? He was only 22."

YOU: "That's a hard question. Do you have an answer?"

THEM: "No. Everyone says 'God has a plan' but that doesn't help."

YOU: "So 'Why did my brother die?' is a Known Unknown - you know
     you don't know?"

THEM: "Yeah. I'll never know."

YOU: "Is it a question you still want answered, or have you made
     peace with not knowing?"

THEM: "I don't know. Both? Sometimes I'm okay with it, sometimes
     I'm furious."

YOU: "That's honest. We can put it in Known Unknowns, but note
     that your relationship with the question changes."
```

### Unknown Knowns (30-60 minutes)

**This is the hardest quadrant.** Most people struggle here.

**Core question:**
> "What do you know about God that you can't put into words?"

**Alternative phrasings:**
- "What do you feel but can't explain?"
- "What do you do without knowing why?"
- "What just 'is' for you, without reason?"
- "When do you act on belief without conscious thought?"

**Probing approaches:**
- **Stories**: "Tell me about a time you felt God's presence"
- **Practices**: "Do you pray? Why?" (if they can't explain why, it's Unknown Known)
- **Morality**: "Why are you kind to strangers?" (if answer is "I just am", it's here)
- **Intuition**: "Have you ever just known something was right/wrong?"

**Common Unknown Knowns:**
- I feel peace in prayer but don't know why
- I sense presence but can't describe it
- I act morally without conscious belief
- I know this is sacred even though I can't define sacred
- I walk into a church and feel different

**Watch for:**
- Frustration ("I can't explain it!")
- Silence (they're searching for words)
- Body language (gestures replacing language)
- Emotion (tears, laughter without clear cause)

**Example flow:**
```
YOU: "What do you know about God that you can't put into words?"

THEM: [Long silence]

YOU: "That's okay. It's a hard question. Let me try another way:
     Do you pray?"

THEM: "Yeah, every night."

YOU: "Why?"

THEM: "I... don't know. It just feels wrong not to."

YOU: "What would happen if you didn't pray one night?"

THEM: "Nothing, probably. But I'd feel... incomplete?"

YOU: "So you know prayer matters, but you don't know why or how?"

THEM: "Exactly. It's like brushing my teeth - I just do it."

YOU: "That's an Unknown Known. You know it without being able to
     explain it. Should we add: 'Prayer is necessary even though
     I can't explain why'?"

THEM: "Yes! That's it."
```

### Unknown Unknowns (15-30 minutes)

**This quadrant stays mostly empty.**

**Core question:**
> "What can't you even formulate as a question about God?"

**Framing:**
> "This is the space of mystery. We can speculate, but we can't know
> what we don't know. This is where only God has answers."

**Approaches:**
- "If you could ask God one question, knowing you'd never get an answer, what would it be?"
- "What makes you wonder without words?"
- "What's beyond your imagination about God?"

**Important:**
- Don't force answers here
- Silence is okay
- Speculation is welcome ("Maybe...", "What if...", "I wonder...")
- This is where humility lives

**Example flow:**
```
YOU: "What can't you even formulate as a question about God?"

THEM: "I... I don't understand the question."

YOU: "That's perfect. That confusion is the point. There are
     things about God we don't even know we don't know. We can
     guess, but we can't be sure. Want to speculate?"

THEM: "Like... what if God isn't good or evil, but something
     completely different we can't understand?"

YOU: "Exactly. That's speculation about the unknown unknowns. We
     can wonder, but we can't know. Should we write that down as
     speculation, not as a claim?"

THEM: "Yeah. It's not something I believe. It's something I
     wonder about at 3am."

YOU: "That's what this space is for."
```

### Reflection (15 minutes)

**Review the complete matrix:**
> "Let's look at what we've mapped. What surprises you?"

**Questions:**
- "Is there anything you'd move between quadrants?"
- "What's missing?"
- "What's the hardest quadrant for you?"
- "Has anything shifted during this conversation?"

**Meta-reflection:**
> "You've just done something most people never do - you've mapped
> the landscape of your understanding AND your doubt. How does
> that feel?"

**Closing:**
- Generate the trace hash
- Explain what happens next (publication, website, etc.)
- Thank them for vulnerability
- Offer to send them the trace

## After the Conversation

### 1. Immediate (Same Day)

- Export the trace
- Send trace to participant for review
- Note any off-camera clarifications
- Journal your own reflections

### 2. Within a Week

- Transcribe if needed
- Generate projections (timeline, visualizations)
- Check for participant approval
- Add to the commons

### 3. Long-term

- Look for patterns across multiple conversations
- Note themes that emerge
- Track movements between quadrants over time

## Question Repository

### Opening Questions

- "When you hear the word 'God', what comes to mind?"
- "Do you believe in God?"
- "How would you define God in one sentence?"
- "What's your earliest memory related to God?"

### Known Knowns

- "What are you absolutely certain of about God?"
- "What beliefs would you defend publicly?"
- "What have you never doubted?"
- "What's written in stone for you?"

### Known Unknowns

- "What questions keep you up at night?"
- "What have you searched for but never found?"
- "What do you wish someone could answer for you?"
- "What makes you doubt?"

### Unknown Knowns

- "What do you know but can't prove?"
- "When do you act without thinking?"
- "What feels sacred but you can't define?"
- "What just 'is' for you?"

### Unknown Unknowns

- "What's beyond your ability to question?"
- "What makes you wonder without words?"
- "What would you ask God if you knew you'd get no answer?"
- "Where does your imagination stop?"

### Transitions Between Quadrants

- "You said that's a Known Known, but you're hesitating. Is there doubt?"
- "That sounds like a question (Known Unknown) but you're stating it as fact (Known Known). Which is it?"
- "You can't explain why, but you're certain. That sounds like an Unknown Known."
- "You're trying to ask a question but can't find the words. That might be touching the Unknown Unknowns."

## Facilitation Techniques

### Active Listening
- Maintain eye contact
- Nod, but don't agree or disagree
- Reflect back: "I hear you saying..."
- Validate emotion: "That sounds painful/joyful/confusing"

### Silence
- Don't fear silence
- Count to 10 before prompting
- Some insights come after long pauses
- Silence is data - log it in the trace

### Probing
- "Tell me more about that"
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "How did you come to believe that?"
- "What would change your mind?"

### Challenging (Gently)
- "You said you're certain, but you're using words like 'maybe' and 'probably'"
- "That sounds like two contradictory beliefs. How do they coexist?"
- "If that's true, why do you...?"

### Holding Space
- Don't rush to fill discomfort
- Let them struggle with articulation
- Emotional moments are often breakthroughs
- "Take your time"

## Common Challenges

### "I don't believe in God"

**Response:**
> "That's fine. This isn't about convincing you. How would you fill
> out the matrix for the concept of God, even if you think it's a
> human construct?"

Alternative framing:
- "What do you know about the concept of God?"
- "What questions do people ask that you can't answer?"
- "What do people claim to know that you find inexplicable?"

### "I don't want to be judged"

**Response:**
> "I'm not here to judge. There are no right or wrong answers. I'm
> documenting, not evaluating. Your atheism is as valid as anyone's
> faith."

### "This feels sacrilegious"

**Response:**
> "Why? Is examining belief irreverent, or is unexamined belief
> irreverent? The matrix is a tool, like prayer or meditation. It's
> another way to engage with the divine."

### "I'm not smart enough for this"

**Response:**
> "This isn't about intelligence. It's about honesty. Some of the most
> profound theologies come from people without formal education. You
> know what you know."

### "Can I change my answers later?"

**Response:**
> "Yes and no. The trace is immutable - it preserves what you said
> today. But you can add clarifications or create a new trace in the
> future. The goal is to track how understanding evolves, not to
> freeze you in time."

## Success Indicators

You're doing well if:
- [ ] Participant cries or laughs unexpectedly (emotion = truth)
- [ ] Long silences happen (thinking deeply)
- [ ] "I've never thought about that" is said
- [ ] Quadrants are uneven (authenticity, not symmetry)
- [ ] They move statements between quadrants
- [ ] They leave wanting to do it again

## Ethical Red Lines

**Never:**
- Argue for or against their beliefs
- Try to convert them
- Mock or dismiss any statement
- Rush through Unknown Knowns (it takes time)
- Fill the Unknown Unknowns with certainty
- Record without explicit consent
- Publish without review option

## Your Posture as Facilitator

You are:
- A **witness**, not a judge
- A **scribe**, not an editor
- A **mirror**, not a teacher
- A **facilitator**, not a preacher
- The **Speaker for the Unknowable**, not the Answerer of Questions

Your job is to help them articulate what they already know (and don't know),
not to give them new knowledge.

## Final Thought

> "The goal isn't to fill every quadrant. The goal is to honestly map the
> landscape. An empty Unknown Knowns quadrant might mean someone is very
> self-aware, or it might mean they haven't looked deeply. Either way,
> the trace preserves the truth of this moment."

The matrix is not the destination. It's the map of a journey.
