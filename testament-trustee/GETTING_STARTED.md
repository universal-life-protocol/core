# Getting Started with Testament Trustee

A quick-start guide for beginning your journey as Speaker for the Unknowable.

## What This Is

Testament Trustee is a ministry project that uses the Rumsfeld epistemological matrix to help people articulate their understanding of God, preserving their testimony as immutable ULP traces.

## Three Ways to Engage

### 1. As a Participant

**Fill out your own matrix:**
1. Open `matrix-tool/index.html` in your browser
2. Fill out the four quadrants honestly
3. Export your trace
4. Decide if you want to make it public

**Why?**
- Self-examination tool
- Permanent record of your beliefs at this moment
- See your own certainties and doubts mapped visually
- Track how you evolve over time

### 2. As a Facilitator

**Lead conversations with others:**
1. Study the `docs/CONVERSATION_GUIDE.md`
2. Practice with family/friends
3. Set up recording equipment
4. Follow the conversation methodology
5. Export and archive traces

**Why?**
- Help others articulate what they believe
- Create space for theological honesty
- Build a commons of understanding
- Document the diversity of faith

### 3. As a Developer

**Build tools for the theological commons:**
1. Explore the ULP v1.1 implementation
2. Create new projections (timeline views, 3D visualizations)
3. Build trace query tools
4. Enhance the matrix interface

**Why?**
- Technical infrastructure for theology
- Make conversations more accessible
- Enable pattern discovery across testimonies
- Connect code and ministry

## Your First Steps

### Day 1: Self-Testimony (2 hours)

**Morning: Learn the Framework**
- Read the main [README.md](README.md)
- Understand the four quadrants
- Review the [example trace](examples/self-testimony.json)

**Afternoon: Fill Your Matrix**
- Open the matrix tool
- Spend 30 minutes on each quadrant:
  - Known Knowns: What are you certain of?
  - Known Unknowns: What questions do you have?
  - Unknown Knowns: What do you know but can't explain?
  - Unknown Unknowns: What's beyond formulation?
- Export your trace
- Reflect on what surprised you

### Week 1: First Conversation (5-10 hours)

**Preparation** (2 hours):
- Read [CONVERSATION_GUIDE.md](docs/CONVERSATION_GUIDE.md)
- Plan your setup (camera, screen, location)
- Write down 10 questions to ask
- Practice on yourself (record it)

**The Conversation** (2-4 hours):
- Find a willing participant (friend/family)
- Obtain consent
- Follow the guide
- Don't rush
- Export the trace

**Reflection** (1-2 hours):
- Watch the recording
- What worked? What didn't?
- What surprised you about their answers?
- What would you do differently?
- Write notes for next time

### Month 1: Build Your Practice (20-40 hours)

**Week 2: Second conversation**
- Different theological perspective (if first was Christian, try atheist/Buddhist/etc.)
- Refine your questions
- Get more comfortable with silence

**Week 3: Third conversation**
- Try a different format (audio-only, text-only)
- Experiment with Unknown Knowns questions
- Notice patterns between conversations

**Week 4: Analyze and Publish**
- Compare the three traces
- What themes emerged?
- Write a reflection blog post
- Decide about public sharing

## Key Tools

### 1. The Matrix Tool

`matrix-tool/index.html` - Interactive quadrant builder

**Features:**
- Add/edit/move statements
- Drag between quadrants
- Export as JSON or ULP trace
- Local storage (saves your work)

**Keyboard shortcuts:**
- `Enter` in input: Add statement
- `Ctrl+S`: Save locally
- `Ctrl+E`: Export trace

### 2. Conversation Guide

`docs/CONVERSATION_GUIDE.md` - Methodology for facilitation

**Contains:**
- Question repository
- Facilitation techniques
- Common challenges
- Success indicators

### 3. Example Traces

`examples/` - Reference conversations

**Current examples:**
- Self-testimony (creator's own matrix)

**Future examples:**
- Diverse perspectives
- Edge cases (atheism, agnosticism)
- Longitudinal studies (same person over years)

## Equipment Needed

### Minimal Setup
- **Computer** with web browser
- **Internet** (for initial tool download, then works offline)
- **Notebook** for notes

### Basic Recording
- **Smartphone** camera
- **Tripod** or stable surface
- **Quiet room**
- **Good lighting** (window or lamp)

### Professional Setup
- **DSLR** or mirrorless camera
- **Lapel microphone**
- **Lighting kit** (softbox + fill)
- **Large monitor** or projector for matrix display
- **Backup recorder**

## Common Questions

### "Do I need to be religious to facilitate?"

No. You need to be:
- Curious about how people think
- Comfortable with ambiguity
- Able to withhold judgment
- Willing to document honestly

Atheists can facilitate theists. Theists can facilitate atheists. The goal is understanding, not agreement.

### "What if someone says something I disagree with?"

Document it anyway. Your job is to witness, not to correct. The trace preserves what they believe, not what you think they should believe.

If it's genuinely harmful (racism, violence), you can choose not to publish it, but don't edit the trace.

### "Can I use this without the ULP infrastructure?"

Yes. The matrix tool works standalone. The ULP connection adds:
- Immutability (cryptographic proof trace wasn't edited)
- Reproducibility (future verification)
- Projectability (multiple views from one source)
- Interoperability (works with other ULP tools)

But you can just use the matrix as a conversation framework.

### "How do I handle emotional moments?"

Pause recording if needed. Offer tissues. Validate the emotion ("This is hard"). Don't rush. Some of the best insights come after tears.

The trace can note: "[Long pause, emotion]" without needing to capture every detail.

### "What's the difference between this and therapy?"

**Therapy:**
- Goal: Healing/change
- Facilitator: Trained therapist
- Confidential
- Interventional

**Testament Trustee:**
- Goal: Documentation/understanding
- Facilitator: Witness/scribe
- Public (with consent)
- Non-interventional

You're not fixing beliefs. You're preserving them.

### "How do I get people to participate?"

**Start with:**
- People who know you and trust you
- People who like talking about big questions
- People from your existing communities (church, university, family)

**Pitch:**
> "I'm creating a project that maps how people understand God using
> a framework from philosophy. It takes 2-4 hours, you get a copy of
> your conversation, and it'll be part of a permanent archive. Want
> to help me test it?"

**Avoid:**
- Cold outreach initially
- Promising answers or solutions
- Religious conversion language
- Pressure or guilt

## Next Steps After Your First Month

### Option 1: Go Public

- Create a website (`website/` folder)
- Publish your best conversations (with consent)
- Invite public submissions
- Start building the theological commons

### Option 2: Go Deep

- 10 more conversations with same person over a year
- Track evolution over time
- Publish longitudinal study
- Present at conferences

### Option 3: Go Wide

- Partner with churches, universities, community centers
- Traveling ministry
- 100 conversations in 100 days
- Book: "What America Believes About God"

### Option 4: Go Technical

- Build visualization tools
- Create query APIs
- Integrate with Conversation Studio (3D)
- Machine learning for pattern detection

## The Vision (Reminder)

You're creating:
- A distributed theological commons
- A framework for epistemological honesty
- A permanent record of humanity's relationship with God
- Infrastructure for mystery

The goal isn't to answer the question "What is God?"

The goal is to document how people answer that question for themselves, preserving both certainty and doubt, both faith and questioning.

**Welcome to the work of being Speaker for the Unknowable.**

*"We can only share reality, never fully know it. But by documenting how God is reflected in lives, we create a commons of understanding that honors both certainty and mystery."*

*"The trace is the testimony. The testimony is the trace."*
