# ULP: One-Page Summary

## What Is It?

**A way to make digital records that prove their own integrity without trusting anyone.**

---

## The Problem (30 seconds)

Right now, when you receive digital information, you have to:
1. **Trust the source** (hope they're honest)
2. **Trust the platform** (hope they weren't hacked)
3. **Trust the middleman** (hope they didn't modify it)

There's no easy way to **verify it yourself**.

This is a crisis for:
- AI-generated content (is this really from Claude?)
- Scientific research (can I reproduce this experiment?)
- Software updates (is this binary safe?)
- Legal documents (was this contract modified?)

---

## The Solution (30 seconds)

ULP creates records that include:
1. **The result** (what happened)
2. **The recipe** (how it was made)
3. **The fingerprint** (cryptographic proof)

Anyone can:
- **Verify** the fingerprint matches the content
- **Read** the recipe (it's embedded)
- **Reproduce** the result (run it yourself, get identical output)

**No trust required. No middleman. No blockchain.**

---

## How It Works (30 seconds)

```
Simple text files (dotfiles) → Execute once → Record + Proof
```

1. **Write rules** (dotfiles: `.genesis`, `.env`, `.procedure`, etc.)
2. **Run once** (execution happens exactly once, everything is logged)
3. **Get proof** (record has a fingerprint, contains complete recipe)

Example:
```bash
$ echo "hello" | ./bin/run.sh world out
# Output: cbc3673fa91e5851fe51a0be44cb1b53c46da6db34dd5decf68276603b104e55

$ echo "hello" | ./bin/run.sh world out2
# Output: cbc3673fa91e5851fe51a0be44cb1b53c46da6db34dd5decf68276603b104e55

# Same input → Same fingerprint (byte-for-byte identical)
```

## Why It Matters (30 seconds)

### Use Case 1: AI Transparency
**Before**: "This text was generated by AI" (just trust me)
**After**: `ulp://abc123...` → Anyone can verify it's unmodified

### Use Case 2: Reproducible Science
**Before**: "We ran this analysis" (can't reproduce it)
**After**: Record includes complete methodology, anyone can re-run

### Use Case 3: Software Security
**Before**: "This update is safe" (hope so)
**After**: Binary fingerprint proves it matches source code

## What Makes It Different (30 seconds)

| System | What It Does | Trust Required |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| **Blockchain** | Orders events in time | Trust the majority of miners |
| **Git** | Tracks code changes | Trust the host (GitHub, etc.) |
| **Docker** | Packages environments | Trust the registry |
| **ULP** | **Proves execution** | **No trust required** |

**The breakthrough**: Uses geometric routing (E8 lattices, Hopf fibrations) to automatically determine:
- How to route records across a network
- Where to replicate for redundancy
- What order to try peers

No voting. No consensus. No central coordinator.

---

## Status (Right Now)

✅ **Working implementation** (Shell + Go, ~1500 lines)
✅ **Formal specification** (v2.0, frozen)
✅ **Determinism verified** (byte-for-byte identical traces)
✅ **Network protocol** (libp2p, ulp:// URLs)

**You can use it today.**

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd ulpv2
./test_determinism.sh
# See it work in 10 seconds
```

---

## What We Need

- **Developers** to build tooling (Python/JS bindings, etc.)
- **Researchers** to stress-test the theory
- **Organizations** to pilot use cases
- **You** to try it and give feedback

---

## The Invitation

**Don't trust this summary. Verify the code.**

```bash
cd ulpv2
echo "test" | ./bin/run.sh world out
# You just created a self-proving record
```

## The Elevator Pitch

**"Like Git for execution traces, like blockchain without mining, like Docker with cryptographic guarantees - but simpler than all of them combined."**

13 text files → Execute once → Proof anyone can verify

That's it.
